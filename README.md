# OOP-Logo-Maker

## Description

-I wanted to create a custom logo generator for future projects.

-While working through this challenge I ran into a few different problems, first I was realizing that while testing not only is syntax important but line items do not always save the same way and that is something to watch out for, I also was calling keys as functions and that was something to remember for the future. Second, moving the generateLogo function to the index.js made my code much easier to debug as I ran into issues.

-I am grateful to the tutor I used, Juan Delgado, because he was helpful in putting me on the right path with how to parse through the SVG docs, I was looking in the wrong places and he helped me to better understand where I needed to look to get the right data and syntax.
